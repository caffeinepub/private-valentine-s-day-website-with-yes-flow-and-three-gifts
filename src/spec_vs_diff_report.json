  "summary": "The diff only shows a modification to project_state.json, which updates metadata but does not restore any backend or frontend code files to Version 3 state. All three acceptance criteria (backend files restored, frontend files restored, version number updated) appear unmet.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Restore the codebase to the exact state of Version 3",
      "reason": "No backend or frontend code files were restored. Only project_state.json metadata was updated. The acceptance criteria require all backend files and all frontend files to match Version 3 state, but the diff shows no changes to any source code files.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest asks to revert to Version 3, not to create a tracking entry for a future reversion. The diff adds AR-1 with status 'pending', suggesting the work has not been completed, rather than actually performing the reversion.",
